</div>


<p>This page will contain all the assignments you submit for the class.</p>
<div id="instructions-for-all-assignments" class="section level3">
<h3>Instructions for all assignments</h3>
<p>I want you to submit your assignment as a PDF, so I can keep a record of what the code looked like that day. I also want you to include your answers on your personal GitHub website. This will be good practice for editing your website and it will help you produce something you can keep after the class is over.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Download the Assignment1.Rmd file from Canvas. You can use this as a template for writing your answers. It’s the same as what you can see on my website in the Assignments tab. Once we’re done with this I’ll edit the text on the website to include the solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>On RStudio, open a new R script in RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; R Script). This is where you can test out your R code. You’ll write your R commands and draw plots here.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have finalized your code, copy and paste your results into this template (Assignment 1.Rmd). For example, if you produced a plot as the solution to one of the problems, you can copy and paste the R code in R markdown by using the <code>``{r} ```</code> command. Answer the questions in full sentences and Save.</p></li>
<li><p>Produce a PDF file with your answers. To do this, knit to PDF (use Knit button at the top of RStudio), locate the PDF file in your docs folder (it’s in the same folder as the Rproj), and submit that on on Canvas in Assignment 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Build Website, go to GitHub desktop, commit and push. Now your solutions should be on your website as well.</p></li>

<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<p><strong>Collaborators: Lorem Ipsum. </strong></p>
<p>This assignment is due on Canvas on Monday 9/20 before class, at 10:15 am. Include the name of anyone with whom you collaborated at the top of the assignment.</p>
<div id="problem-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p>Install the datasets package on the console below using <code>install.packages("datasets")</code>. Now load the library.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(datasets)</code></pre>
<p>Load the USArrests dataset and rename it <code>dat</code>. Note that this dataset comes with R, in the package datasets, so there’s no need to load data from your computer. Why is it useful to rename the dataset?</p>
<p>It is useful to rename datasets because it gives us a shorthand to work with. So in this case, instead of referring to the data with “USArrests” we can ref to it with dat.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat &lt;- USArrests</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="problem-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>Use this command to make the state names into a new variable called State.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat$state &lt;- tolower(rownames(USArrests))</code></pre>
<p>This dataset has the state names as row names, so we just want to make them into a new variable. We also make them all lower case, because that will help us draw a map later - the map function requires the states to be lower case.</p>
<p>List the variables contained in the dataset <code>USArrests</code>.</p>

<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Murder&quot;   &quot;Assault&quot;  &quot;UrbanPop&quot; &quot;Rape&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The four variables are “Murder”, “Assault”, “UrbanPop”, and “Rape” (and the state variable which we created).</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 3</h3>
<p>What type of variable (from the DVB chapter) is <code>Murder</code>?</p>
<p>Answer: It is a quantitative variable because this variable is representing some numerical value in relation to a state.</p>
<p>What R Type of variable is it?</p>
<p>Answer: This variable is a character because the word murder itself is represented in a string format.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 4</h3>
<p>What information is contained in this dataset, in general? What do the numbers mean?</p>
<p>Answer: The dataset contains information about murder, assault, and rape. Additionally, it seems to give us some numbers for a states urban population to help see the relation aswell. These numbers show us the relationship with often they are occuring) of these different variables in different states. For example a number for murder is telling it there was some amount of murders within this state (and we can compare this to other states by seeing how much more or less these crimes occur in other states).</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 5</h3>
<p>Draw a histogram of <code>Murder</code> with proper labels and title.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>hist(dat$Murder, main = &quot;Histogram of Murder&quot;, xlab = &quot;States&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Journal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="problem-6" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 6</h3>
<p>Please summarize <code>Murder</code> quantitatively. What are its mean and median? What is the difference between mean and median? What is a quartile, and why do you think R gives you the 1st Qu. and 3rd Qu.?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  summary(dat$Murder)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   0.800   4.075   7.250   7.788  11.250  17.400</code></pre>
<p>Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.800 4.075 7.250 7.788 11.250 17.400</p>
<p>The mean is 7.788 and the median and 7.250. The mean is the average of the dataset while the median gives us a central value of our dataset. A quartile tells us the variability around the median. So the 1st and 3rd quartiles show us the variability before the median is reached and after the median is reached. R gives us this data to show us where it might be more or less skewed.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-7" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 7</h3>
<p>Repeat the same steps you followed for <code>Murder</code>, for the variables <code>Assault</code> and <code>Rape</code>. Now plot all three histograms together. You can do this by using the command <code>par(mfrow=c(3,1))</code> and then plotting each of the three.</p>
<p>Answer (for data on the other two variables) : For assaults, the mean is 170.8 and the median and 159.0.</p>
<p>For rapes, the mean is 21.23 and the median and 20.10.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(dat$Murder)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   0.800   4.075   7.250   7.788  11.250  17.400</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(dat$Assault)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    45.0   109.0   159.0   170.8   249.0   337.0</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(dat$Rape)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    7.30   15.07   20.10   21.23   26.18   46.00</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>par(mfrow=c(3,1))
hist(dat$Assault, main = &quot;Histogram of Assault&quot;, xlab = &quot;States&quot;)
hist(dat$Murder, main = &quot;Histogram of Murder&quot;, xlab = &quot;States&quot;)
hist(dat$Rape, main = &quot;Histogram of Rape&quot;, xlab = &quot;States&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Journal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>What does the command par do, in your own words (you can look this up by asking R <code>?par</code>)?</p>
<p>Answer: It helps us combine multiple plots that we created into one big vertical plot.</p>
<p>What can you learn from plotting the histograms together?</p>
<p>Answer: We can see the correlation between the data. If there are some points where there is a peak at the same time then we can generalize and say that state could be more dangerous than others. This could work likewise for the converse situation.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-8" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 8</h3>
<p>In the console below (not in text), type <code>install.packages("maps")</code> and press Enter, and then type <code>install.packages("ggplot2")</code> and press Enter. This will install the packages so you can load the libraries.</p>
<p>Run this code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(&#39;maps&#39;) 
library(&#39;ggplot2&#39;) 

ggplot(dat, aes(map_id=state, fill=Murder)) + 
  geom_map(map=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)) + 
  expand_limits(x=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)$long, y=map_data(&quot;state&quot;)$lat)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Journal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="720" /></p>
<p>What does this code do? Explain what each line is doing.</p>
<p>Answer: The first two lines import the libraries map and ggplot2. Line 154 imports dat wants to define the map id of states with murder. The second line is filling out map with state data.The third line maps it out in a x and y axis so we can see the data in states.</p>

<div id="problem-2-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem 2: Variables</h2>
<p>Describe the variables in the dataset.</p>
<p>The variables are mjage, ciage, iralcage, age2, sexatract, speakengl, and irsex. They each tell us different things. Mjage tells how old someone was when they first starting using marijuana. Ciage tells how old someone was when they first starting smoking cigs every day. iralcage tells how old someone was when they tried alcohol. age2 tells us hpw old the person currently is. However, this gives us a range because a person could have changes their choice based on previous responses and the questions they say. Irsex tells us their gender. sexatract tells us describes their attraction/sexuality. speakengl tells how well the individual speaks english.</p>
<p>What is this dataset about? Who collected the data, what kind of sample is it, and what was the purpose of generating the data?</p>
<p>This dataset is a survey about national drug use and health. The data is sponsored by the United States Health and Human Services. The sample is a scientific random sample of household addresses. This data gives us a state and nationwide statistics on drug use. This information is used to help with prevention, trend studies, and inform public health policy.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-3-age-and-gender" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem 3: Age and gender</h2>
<p>What is the age distribution of the sample like? Make sure you read the codebook to know what the variable values mean.</p>
<p>The age distribution is more towards the 13-17 year old range. However, when we look at this data we should understand that it can be more of a range since participants could change their answers based on the decisions on they made or what they see fit.</p>
<p>Do you think this age distribution representative of the US population? Why or why not?</p>
<p>I believe this data not a good representative of the US population. We are looking at a younger population that makes up around 35% of the age distribution. So we are leaving out a large majority that can help us see more trends.</p>
<p>Is the sample balanced in terms of gender? If not, are there more females or males?</p>
<p>I believe this data is pretty balanced. There is a pretty even distribution but for some of the ages we can see that there is a clear majority like for 17.</p>
<p>Use this code to draw a stacked bar plot to view the relationship between sex and age. What can you conclude from this plot?</p>

<p>We see that the largest amount of people (136) chose 1. Yes, this is what I expected since it is the norm to be heterosexual.</p>
<p>What is the distribution of sexual attraction by gender?</p>

<h2>Problem 6: English speaking</h2>
<p>What does the distribution of English speaking look like in the sample? Is this what you might expect for a random sample of the US population?</p>

<p>The majority of people chose that they speak english very well. And there were very few who chose well and not well (10 total). This is probably what I would expect since it is the dominant language.</p>
<p>Are there more English speaker females or males?</p>

<p>This distribution is skewed to the right. This isn’t exactly what I expected, (I thought it would be skewed even more to the right.) because I believed that victims would be a lot younger.</p>

<p>I would use mean to understand the center of the age distribution because I don’t believe there are enough outliers/extremes that would skew this result substantially. The mean gives us an average over our data. We can see that the average age of victims for police fatal shootings were 37.12 years old.</p>

<p>Within this dataset, there are significantly more men than women (6005 more). This is not surprising because statistics have shown that men have been higher arrest rate than women. Since men have a higher arrest rate than women and more encounters with police, I expected there to be more men than women within this dataset.

<p>Out of 6103 incidents that recorded something in the fleeing category, 2151 victims were fleeing. This means about 35% of people who were a victim of a fatal police shooting were fleeing.

Additionally, there is 491 indexes of data that are blank for fleeing, so this was removed from the total number of incidents and the proportion since it is inconclusive.</p>

<p>We see from the data that some races have a slightly lower mean age than others. For examples, the mean age for white people looks to be around 40, while the mean age for black people seems to be about 35. Additionally, some races have a lot more outliers than others. For example, asian people have no outliers while black people have a lot of outliers. It is hard to make a concrete conclusion based on this relationship, but we can observe that there are clear small differences that we can observe (as stated above) from the different races and their ages. Furthermore, the first category simple represent people who did not have a specified age (left blank in the dataset). I did not omit this data because I think it could still be important to see this in relation to the other data.</p>

<p>This data tells us how long it has been since the first entry within this dataset to the most recent entry within the dataset. We are taking the first index because the 0th index states the name of each column, and we are taking the last index to get the last entry. The difference is 2458 days which is about 6.7 years.

</ol>
<p>I believe this is because of bias. Police who have been apart of police killings are going to defend themselves. In order to do so, they might underreport or mislabel the incident in order to save face and justify the actions they took. Additionally, co workers of police who have been apart of such an incident may look to defend each other building even more of a bias.</p>

There are 200 observations of different police departments and the number of incidences where police brutality occurred. We see that on average a department gets around 61 million dollars in funding and will have about 18 incidences of police brutality that year. We can see from the graph that there is a clear decrease in the number of police brutality incidences as the amount of funding goes up. Furthermore, we can see that the correlation between these two values is a -0.98 which indicates there is a extremely strong linear relationship (in this case it is a negative one).</p>

</ol>
<p>The estimated coefficient for the slope is -0.367 while the estimated coefficient for the intercept is 40.54. The p-value for the slope is less than 2 x 10^-16 (this is the same of the intercept as well). These slope has a standard error of 0.0045 which means that regression we have is very close to the actual value. This means that there exists a linear relationship between the funds and the incidents statically as each of these p-values are less than 0.05. This means that we can reject the null hypothesis and assert that there is a linear relationship.</p>

<p>2.Independence assumption : This doesn’t hold because there is a pattern in our graph for residuals vs x.</p>
<p>3.Equal variance assumption : This assumption probably doesn’t hold because our scale-location plot isn’t straight and there is a pattern with it.</p>

<p>Because our assumptions do not hold, we can’t use this linear regression model to determine if more funding will lead to a decrease of police brutality.

<p>Describe the dataset. Considering our lecture on data ethics, what concerns do you have about the dataset? Once you perform your analysis to answer the question of interest using this dataset, what concerns might you have about the results?</p>
<p>This dataset gives us the funding a police department receives and the amount of police brutality that occurs. From our data ethics lecture, an issue we could come across is correlation doesn’t imply causation. So even though we have a very high correlation, this doesn’t necessary mean that the two variables are related. People could potentially look at this correlation and see the regression without realizing that our assumption didn’t hold.</p>
<p>This matters because people could use this data or data like this to push a false narrative that could damage people. This is an important example to see that we have to check everything because if we forget and show some false information it could cause people to believe ideas that are not true.</p>
